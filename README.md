## Hybrid Framework
Hybrid Framework in Selenium is a concept where we are using the advantage of both Keyword driven framework as well as Data driven framework. It is an easy to use framework which allows manual testers to create test cases by just looking at the keywords, test data and object repository without coding in the framework.
